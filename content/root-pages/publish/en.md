# Publish data

Data from the Confederation, cantons, municipalities and other organisations with a mandate from the state can be published on LINDAS. Since LINDAS is still in build-up mode, the Federal Archives are currently only publishing selected datasets on the platform.

Register at [support-lindas@bar.admin.ch](mailto:support-lindas@bar.admin.ch) if you are interested in publishing data on LINDAS.

## Publish Data Cubes

Data Cubes (see [https://cube.link/](https://cube.link/)) are a specific form of data in OLAP like cubes which can be consumed by a multitude of tools, eg. [https://visualize.admin.ch/](https://visualize.admin.ch/en). For data to be compatible with the different tools some additional requirements might be necessary.
