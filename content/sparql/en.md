# Query Data

To search in data from a specific dataset, use a SPARQL query. SPARQL (pronounced \"sparkle\", a recursive acronym for SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is an RDF Query Language. All data on LINDAS are available in the RDF format. You can re-use such queries and combine them with other data.
