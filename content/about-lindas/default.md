### LINDAS

The [Swiss Federal Archives](https://www.bar.admin.ch/bar/en/home.html) provides the Linked Data Service LINDAS. This service includes a tool for data conversion and data integration as well as a data storage infrastructure (Triplestore).

Via LINDAS, Swiss authorities can make their [data available](https://lindas.admin.ch/publish/?lang=en) in the form of [knowledge graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph#:~:text=In%20knowledge%20representation%20and%20reasoning,%E2%80%93%20with%20free%2Dform%20semantics.). Developers can access this data via the [Query Data](https://lindas.admin.ch/sparql/?lang=en) section.

The [Federal Office for the Environment](https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/en/home.html) uses LINDAS to make environmental data accessible to humans and machines and has developed [Visualize](https://www.visualize.admin.ch/en), a web application for the visualization of data sets. With this tool, data provided by LINDAS can be visualized and embedded in web pages.
