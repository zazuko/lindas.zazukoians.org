This is a Trifid instance that we are using to perform some tests before upgrading the real instance for Lindas.

## Quick Start

Clone this repo, then run the following commands:

```sh
npm install # install all required dependencies
npm run start # this will start the instance and expose it at http://0.0.0.0:8080/
```

And open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080/
